This is a noughts and crosses game that can be played by either 1 or 2 players.

To run the file enter python3 main.py.
This will initialise the game and ask if you want to play with 1 or 2 players.
If 1 players is selected one of either the noughts player or the crosses player will be controlled by the computer. The computer may go either first of second.
If 2 players are selected then each player will take turns making their move.
When it is your turn in the game, you will be prompted to enter a number 1-9, representing each possible space in the grid. You cannot enter a space that already has a nought or cross in the space, if you do so you will be prompted to enter a valid number. You can also enter q to quit.
If a player gets a winning condition the game will end and the player who won will be displayed.
If after 9 turns there is no winner, the game will end and display that there was no winner.
